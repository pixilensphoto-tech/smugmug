1. COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP AND WORK FOR HIRE

1.1 All Work Product created by Photographer during the engagement, including but not limited to photographs, videos, audio recordings, edited files, raw files, negatives, digital files, prints, and any reproductions thereof (the "Work Product"), shall constitute "works made for hire" as defined under Section 101 of Title 17 of the United States Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.) to the maximum extent permitted by law.

1.2 To the extent any Work Product does not qualify as a work made for hire under applicable law, Client hereby irrevocably assigns to Photographer, and Photographer hereby accepts, all right, title, and interest in and to the Work Product, including all intellectual property rights therein, throughout the world, in perpetuity.

1.3 Photographer shall be the sole and exclusive owner of all copyrights, moral rights, and other intellectual property rights in and to the Work Product, including the right to reproduce, distribute, display, perform, transmit, create derivative works from, and otherwise exploit the Work Product in any and all media now known or hereafter devised, without restriction.

1.4 Client acknowledges and agrees that Photographer retains full copyright ownership of the Work Product and that this Agreement does not transfer any copyright ownership to Client, except as expressly stated herein.

2. LICENSE TO USE WORK PRODUCT

3.3 Photographer may license the Work Product to third parties for editorial, educational, or commercial use, provided that such third-party use does not directly compete with Client's business or imply Client's endorsement of any third-party product or service.
